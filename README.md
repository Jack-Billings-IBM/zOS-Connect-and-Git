# Using Git with you z/OS Connect Projects <!-- omit in toc -->

### Introduction

This tutorial walks through how to work with the Git source code management tool in your z/OS Connect projects. You'll learn some of the best practices for organizing your z/OS Connect project in a git repository and how to use git to manage changes to your projects.

This work is being done as part of a series of code patterns and tutorials centered on bringing DevOps practices to z/OS Connect projects.

### Prerequisites:

- IBM Explorer for z/OS must be installed, or any other IBM Eclipse based editor. If it is not installed please reference this guide on doing so: [Installing IBM Explorer for z/OS Aqua](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBDYH_3.2/com.ibm.zexpl.install.client.doc/topics/install20.html)
- The EGit plugin for Eclipse. If you do not have the plugin installed you can follow the instructions in our other code pattern in this series that goes over how to install the plugin and work with git using the plugin. [EGit Installation for IBM Explorer for z/OS]() _Link needs to be added once the code pattern is published_
- The z/OS Connect Perspective. _Not sure if this is something we should include steps for getting installed or if there is already an asset for this out there._
- A GitHub account

### Estimated time

_TBD once code pattern is finished_
